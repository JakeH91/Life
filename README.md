    <!-- When herbie dies, slowly decay instead of disapper. (Completed 27/10/17) -->

    <!-- Create generic die function. (Completed 29/10/17) -->
    <!-- Create generic decay function. (Completed 29/10/17) -->
        ISSUES:
        <!-- (I001): Above 2 functions fail with more than one of each species (causing crash) (29/10/17) -->
        <!-- (I002): While lifeform decays, all of same species (under index of the decaying) freeze and resume                     movement once the decaying is removed. (29/10/17) -->

    Generate different speeds amoungst creature generation.
    Regenerate leaves over time.
    Background colour change according to time passed (to simulate day and night).
